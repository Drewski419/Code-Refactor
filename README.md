# CLEAN UP CODES FOR BETTER VISUALIZATION

## Summary

My objective was was to group sections together so that the review can see at a glance what I did with ease.  I also spent much time merging many of the codes together where many were redundant and/or wasn't needed at all.

# The top right section

I had the hardest time using the div code to try and get those three titles side by side.  I created a few more classes to get that section to float (you will see my float classes).

# The branding section

Was very difficult in that I tried mergining many of the codes.  I was able to delete many of codes that were redundant and moved a couple of id tags that weren't used.
